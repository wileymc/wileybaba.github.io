Aside from computer code, I haven’t written in a long time. Words don’t seem to come as easy to me as they did during college, which is unfortunate because now that I find myself in my late twenties, I have much more to write about than I did back then. My opinions are more nuanced and well contemplated and my knowledge base has dramatically improved since I moved on from the restrictions of the university setting. But alas, the right words escape me.

As I sit here, looking out across the breadth of the mighty Nile river from a well positioned encampment deck in eastern Uganda, I listen. I listen to the group of British youths chuckling about the escapades of their tour, their fear of malaria. I think to myself, I’m glad that I am immune to that tropical pestilence. In reality, I’m not immune, but I’ve decided to forgo the daily doses of gut destroying anti-malarial medication and therefore I am comforted in my delusion. I prefer this delusion to the potential delusions induced by certain anti-malarial capsules. Mind over matter.

Brian sits to my right, deliberating over how to minimize the costs of his now expensive flight back to the United States. He hasn’t been back in two and a half years. I’ve only been in Africa for less than three months and I already miss the comforts of home. Extra virgin olive oil, hot showers, livable cities. And yet, I don’t look forward to the price gauging that I will inevitably face as soon as I step off the airplane in Queens. In Uganda, a single U.S. dollar can buy an entire plate of food—albeit of questionable nutritious value. When I opt for the organic salad in lower Manhattan, I’ll be lucky if it costs twenty times the amount.
