In 1973 Ivan Illich published a philosophical text titled _Tools for Conviviality_ in which he argued that modern society is structured in a way that prevents humans from reaching their full potential. He defines _covivial tools_ as institutions and apparatuses that foster creativity, social productivity, and togetherness.

There are serious negative social consequences of hyper-industrialization and more recently, the rampant dataism that defines modern machine driven wealth creation. Our current social climate is dominated by professional services and instantaneous gratification, be it our Instagram feeds or our same day Amazon Prime orders. We are able to harness the power of modern technology through a multitude of tools—and although our access to this abundant new toolset has allowed for impressive economic growth across most industries, many of these tools have fettered our personal growth and inhibited the building of strong supportive communities.

We need tools that do not entrap people, but rather serve them—to communicate, to develop relationships, and to live together harmoniously. We need to break the cycle of perpetual dissatisfaction and yearning for more. While the modern toolset has immense potential to foster these aspirations, those using these tools have very little control over the processes of production that are shaping their lives so actively. The internet has allowed for the widespread and free dissemination of knowledge, but unfortunately control of the most widely used tools available on the internet is concentrated in the hands of a few powerful corporations.

For the purpose of this essay, I will define personal growth as the phenomena of improving oneself, physically, mentally, and spiritually. Improving our abilities to connect, reason, and live with others is also a crucial element of personal growth. This interpersonal development has been challenged by many of the tools of modernity. Human connection has been commoditized and coded into software networks that reach most of the world. We are constantly interacting with these networks, providing streams content instantly available for others consumption. Likewise, we have a constant stream of content created by others available for our entertainment. In these networks we seek crucial answers to life’s most pressing questions. How do we live purposeful and fulfilling lives? What moral codes should we live by? How do we approach relationships with other humans and the rest of the planet?

The ubiquity of such modern tooling has altered how we connect with others in such a fundamental way that any transition away from the current regime will be difficult—but worth it.

The current regime, completely dependent on unrestricted growth of industry, is exacerbating biological degradation, establishing radical and unstoppable monopolies, and polarizing the populace. Societies need to refocus attention on tools that bring together wide ranges of human skills and resources, while preserving individual freedom and autonomy. In the spirit of Ivan Illich, I suggest we reach for a new set of tools, tools for conviviality.
