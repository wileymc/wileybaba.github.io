The year started of in royal fashion, with a roomates trip to the Baja. All was well until an unfortunate beach volleyball incident obliterated my left knee.

![Day of injury](../images/photos/fat_knee.jpg)

I had hopped up and tipped a ball at the net and landed gracefully without issue, but to my chagrin one of my cocksure buddies on the opposing team recklessly dove for my well placed touch, where he met my planted left thigh with his shoulder, nearly 200 pounds, and the force of an overzealous recreational athlete.

The first doctor who examined my MRI bluntly said "its not looking good." He followed up with "I haven't done one of these in years" and expressed grave concern as he rushed me off to get scheduled with a more capable orthopedic surgeon.

In addition to a full tear of my ACL and a partial PCL tear, my MCL was also fully torn at the distal tibial attachment. It was immediately evident that this injury would leave me crippled without surgical intervention, and thus began my healing journey. On March 11, I was operated on and successfully fitted with reconstructions of the ACL, MCL, and PCL. I opted for allografts (donor tissue) for all of the new ligaments because unfortunately, taking a piece of my own patellar tendon for the new ACL would have made the recovery even more brutal and given the wide scope of the procedure, I believe it was the correct choice.

## Mental Load Balancing

This injury and the subsequent recovery have been extremely challenging. The daily movement routine that I became so accustomed to—morning jump rope, burpees, and TRX training followed by evening yoga and stretching—was no longer viable. Exercise is my outlet for expunging frustration and tension. Now that I am so limited in what I am able to do, I am struggling to find ways to expel that frustration and tension.

I had finally built up a consistent routine prior to the injury, and now I cannot walk without crutches. While this is only temporary, which I try to remind myself regularly, it has tested my mental fortitude in a serious way. I have battled bouts of depression and immense sadness. These feelings are compounded by the difficulties of carrying out once trivial tasks. Despite this, I am immensely optimistic for my recovery and have been keeping up with my physical therapy program intently.

## Rehab and Redemption

I am currently just over 4 weeks post-op. According to doctors orders, which I am following closely, I cannot bear weight on the new knee for another 2 weeks. After the 6 weeks of non-weight-bearing, I will progressively add weight on to the affected leg over two weeks until full weight bearing is comfortably achieved. In the mean time, my physical therapy is quite limited due to the scope of the injury and repairs. Each of the various ligaments I had reconstructed has its own set of restrictions when it comes to movement.

For the time being, my routine looks like this:

- seated flexion with assist from good leg
- quad sets on rolled up towel
- short quad arcs on foam roller
- straight leg raise
- sidelying straight leg raise for glute activation
- prone straight leg raise
- heel slides (with strap assist)
- heel post to improve extension

I know this routine forwards and backwards and am excited for full weight bearing and the next level of exercises that will unlock. Onwards and upwards.
