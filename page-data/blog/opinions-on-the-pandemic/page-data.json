The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown us the the vulnerability of our species to the invisible workings of the microbial world. It has shown us the resilience and strength of health care workers, educators, small business owners, and average citizens alike in the wake of massive societal disruption. We have suffered loss and grief, anger and frustration, distance and isolation. One year in, we are still faced with pressing questions and decisions about how we move forward.</p>\n<h2>The \"Gold Standard\" of Testing</h2>\n<p>Around the world the gold standard for detecting presence of the virus in a individual is the rt-PCR method (quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction). Developed in 1985 by Kary Mullis, the PCR technique allows scientists to make many copies of a scarce segment of DNA/RNA from a tissue sample. PCR is used in everything from cancer screening to food safety testing. It allows for the detection of a very specific target nucleic acid sequence, but is not necessarily indicative of the presence of an active organism associated with that sequence. In Mullis own words, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Xc0Kysti6Kc?t=30\" title=\"Kary Mullis on PCR\">\"with PCR—if you do it well—you can find almost anything, in anybody.\"</a> In other words, PCR allows the agent to amplify a minute quantity of viral RNA into something of clinical significance. The number of amplification cycles use for a given PCR is known as the cycle threshold (CT). <a href=\"https://youtu.be/S_1Z8cSXI-Q\" title=\"Cycle threshold and infectivity\">Although a correlation has been shown between detection of viral RNA at a lower CT and increased infectivity</a>, the CT is rarely reported with the binary test results.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the PCR test <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html\" title=\"NYT: Your Coronavirus Test Is Positive. Maybe It Shouldn’t Be.\">does not distinguish between infectious and non-infectious virus.</a> Tests can pick up dead or non-viable fragments of viral RNA—if you beat off the virus 4 months ago, you could still test positive. To detect true infectivity of a sample, the isolation of the virus by culture methods is required. Unfortunately, such methods are time consuming, complex, and must be conducted in specialized laboratories with biocontainment facilities. Due to this burden, viral cultures is rarely being done. <strong>A positive PCR test in no way equates to being infected or to being infectious.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It is important to note that detecting viral material by PCR does not indicate that the virus is fully intact and infectious, i.e. able to cause infection in other people. The isolation of infectious virus from positive individuals requires virus culture methods. These methods can only be conducted in laboratories with specialist containment facilities and are time consuming and complex.” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/niall_boylan/status/1301285620996861953?lang=en\" title=\"Niall Bolan on PCR\">[7]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In an ironic plot twist, Florida of all states, <a href=\"https://www.flhealthsource.gov/files/Laboratory-Reporting-CT-Values-12032020.pdf\" title=\"Florida Surgeon General&#x27;s memo on COVID-19 testing\">is now requiring testing laboratories to report the cycle threshold values and their reference ranges</a>, along with the positive or negative result.  The intention behind Florida's institution of this policy may be questionable, but either way it is a step towards getting a hold of more nuanced and actionable data on this virus.   </p>\n<h2>Excess Deaths and Hospitalizations</h2>\n<p>It is tragic and undisputable that we are seeing significant excess deaths (deaths from all causes compared to last year). But as many immunologists, virologists, and public health professionals are beginning to point out, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eci.13423\" title=\"Global perspective of COVID-19 epidemiology for a full-cycle pandemic\">\"differentiating between COVID‐19 deaths and those due to harmful response measures is challenging.\"</a>  Now, and in the coming years, increases in excess mortality can also be attributed to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>People forgoing treatment for life threatening ailments due to the perceived threat of SARS-CoV-2</li>\n<li>Financial crises, unemployment, depression, and isolation have all been shown to increase mortality from all causes</li>\n<li>Suicide, alcoholism, and other diseases of despair</li>\n<li>Disruption of tuberculosis and other preventative health programs globally</li>\n<li>Disruption in food production and transport, causing acute starvation with potential to worsen in coming years</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With many false positives due to the nature of PCR testing described above, the number of deaths attributed to infection with SARS-CoV-2 is likely inflated. Just because someone has a positive PCR test and is admitted to the hospital, that does not mean that SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of their acute illness. Many patients have severe chronic illnesses, coupled with a positive PCR test, and their admittance into the hospital is being counted as a COVID-19 admittance. This inflates hospitalization rates and paints a poor picture of the severity of the pandemic. Furthermore, anyone who dies with a positive PCR test, regardless of their co-morbidities or the true cause of death, can be counted as a COVID-19 death. Someone could break their leg and die of femoral artery bleed out but because you tested positive a day earlier, you could be added to the pandemic death toll. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, with the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/readiness/funding-covid.htm\" title=\"CDC on the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020\">legislation introduced back in March</a>, there is a perverse incentive for these deaths to be counted as COVID-19 deaths because with more cases and deaths from SARS-CoV-2, hospitals are eligible for more funding.  While I agree that funding needs to be properly allocated to the health care sector in a public health crises where there is acute need, it is undeniable that there is a profound conflict of interest going on.  And while most health care professionals are well-intentioned and loving people, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2019/06/26/top-u-s-non-profit-hospitals-ceos-are-racking-up-huge-profits/?sh=19b8fd2d19df\" title=\"Forbes: Hospital CEOs Racking up Huge Profits\">top executives at many of the United States non-profit hospitals are taking home tens of millions of dollars in compensation each year.  Instead of using their coffers of excess cash to lower costs for patients, these institutions are spending millions on lobbying to preserve the status quo and receive additional funding.</a> The healthcare industry is deeply flawed and is a topic for another dissertation, but it is safe to say that the pandemic has further highlighted the <a href=\"https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/press/new-study-hospitals-hike-charges-18-times-cost\" title=\"National Nurses United: Hospitals Hike Charges by up to 18 times cost\">extreme price gauging</a> that hospitals are engaging in.          </p>\n<p>Lastly, the pandemic has severely disrupted global health programs, and shifted emphasis and funding away from prevention of much more virulent and widespread public health crises.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Putting projections together, the excess deaths from the measures taken is likely to be much larger than the COVID‐19 deaths, for example, disruption of tuberculosis programmes alone is expected to cause 1.4 million extra deaths over the next 5 years and the death toll from famine can be even more staggering\" <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eci.13423\" title=\"Global perspective of COVID-19 epidemiology for a full-cycle pandemic\">[4]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There will be serious global health consequences to this disruption, and we cannot continue to focus our entire public health dialogue on a single malady.</p>\n<h2>Mob Mentality, Shaming, and the Politics of Fear</h2>\n<p>Aside from the acute risk of getting sick or dying, one of the scariest pieces of this pandemic is the blind acceptance of the imposed draconian and authoritarian measures by people around the world. While there are real reasons to be concerned about this new virus, <em><strong>the public fear surrounding COVID-19 has been elevated to levels that are completely out of proportion with the actual risks.</strong></em> Many will say that they are \"following the science\" but there are serious academic hurdles to understanding said science, and so instead, we rely heavily on the media–namely social media–to define the narrative for us. And terrifyingly, many opinions that are contrary to the mainstream are being censored. For example <a href=\"https://lbry.tv/Mike-Yeadon-Unlocked:0\" title=\"Dr Michael Yeadon believes the pandemic is over\">this video</a> containing a cautionary dialog from Dr. Michael Yeadon, was ripped from YouTube. As a biologist and pharmacologist who specializes in respiratory health, the man is highly qualified to speak on the topic. <strong>Even if what someone like Dr. Michael Yeadon is saying contains some inaccuracies, this blatant censorship sets a dangerous precedent.</strong></p>\n<p>The pro-censorship argument is obviously the classic: you mustn't yell \"FIRE\" in a crowded room that is not burning. Yet the outcries against these excessive lockdowns and quarantine measures are doing nothing comparable. On the contrary, the room is certainly on fire, and the media and our politicians are the arsonists. Against the grain and in spite of this wave of Stalinesque censorship, science, data, and evidence still emerge that support a rational idea: <strong>our extreme reaction to the pandemic may be short sighted and end up doing more harm than good.</strong></p>\n<p>Without the whole picture painted for them, it seems that the masses are dedicated to a religion of unquestioning obedience. It seems we have lost the ability to think freely and critically about the world at large.  Instead, we are welcoming tyrannical policies with zero room for debate.  Authoritarian governments have long used this recipe.  By playing into the idea that others freedoms are a threat to our wellbeing, the government can control our movements, behaviors, spending, and much more.  We have made it illegal to congregate, to dance freely with others, to smile at strangers in the grocery store. We have closed restaurants doors, canceled live music, and shut down schools and playgrounds. And yet, we have accepted it as the <em>only</em> reasonable way to proceed?  </p>\n<p>As we saw with the onset of the holidays, many commentators took to their platforms of choice to dispel the evils of the usual Thanksgiving celebrations. Wherever you stand on the COVID-19 situation, it is harmful and nonsensical to shame people for taking minute risks to spend time with their family and friends. Our elders, moreso than anyone, need to be loved, supported, and interacted with. If you're sick, yes wear a mask around grandma or wait to visit, but do not use this virus as an excuse to neglect your elderly loved ones. Asinine and reactionary policies have further isolated our senior citizens and this madness needs to end.  </p>\n<p>As global markets reach new all time highs, so do unemployment rates. The dichotomy is elucidating: large and highly capitalized players are profiting at the expense of the average citizen. I will save the technocracy discussion for a later post, but I will emphasize that our reactionary policies to this pandemic have dramatically increased our reliance on technologies that are yielding their creators massive profits.  The draconian measures we have taken in the name of public health have further marginalized the downtrodden and create an even starker division between the haves and the have-nots. While the privileged stay home and order delivery and niceties from Amazon Prime, the brunt of herd immunity is being passed on to those who must leave their homes and interact with the public to make a living.</p>\n<h2>The Vaccine Promise</h2>\n<p>We have seen promising initial results for a number of new vaccine trials in the past few weeks, and the FDA just recently <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19\" title=\"FDA: Emergency Use Authorization for First COVID-19 Vaccine\">approved Pfizer's for emergency use in the United States</a>.  <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a34787908/what-is-mrna-covid-19-vaccine-pfizer-moderna/\" title=\"Popular Mechanics: Everything you need to know about mRNA\">The science and technology behind these mRNA vaccines</a> is quite brilliant, and I am a huge proponent of ethical application of genetic engineering. That said, I am highly skeptical of rushed and inadequately tested technologies.  I am hesitant to push a piece of poorly tested software into production, so to me it seems a bit premature to be pumping people with experimental genetic technologies without a full understanding of the long term implications. But lets take a step back, and look at what we know about the vaccines so far.</p>\n<p>The trials for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2020/09/23/covid-19-vaccine-protocols-reveal-that-trials-are-designed-to-succeed/?sh=633340155247\" title=\"Forbes: Covid-19 Vaccine Protocols\">designed to detect a reduction in symptoms</a>, and in no way investigated any reduction in the propensity to become infected.  The vaccine manufacturers are <a href=\"https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/trends/not-certain-pfizer-ceo-on-if-their-covid-vaccine-stops-transmission/story/424015.html\" title=\"Business Today: Pfizer CEO on if their Covid vaccine stops transmission\">very hesitant to claim that their new products reduce the transmission of the virus and there is much uncertainty.</a>  Like the yearly flu shots that millions receive for Influenza, these vaccines would work to reduce the severity of sickness from infection by SARS-CoV-2.  That is a commendable intention, but most of the commentary has been under the false assumption that these vaccines would work to stop the spread.</p>\n<p>The proponents of lockdowns and strict distancing measures use arguments that hinge on asymptomatic transmission being a major contributor to rising case counts and untamed spread of the virus. This same contingency will likely call for vaccination certificates and argue that we have a moral obligation to be vaccinated to protect high risk groups.  Yet, these demands are dependent on vaccines actually reducing the transmission of the virus and we have no clue if they reduce infection, let alone transmission.  What they have been shown to do, in limited and short term trials, is to reduce symptoms.    </p>\n<p>So what do we get with vaccines that reduce symptoms but do not guarantee mitigation of infectiousness or transmission? A shift from symptomatic infection to asymptomatic infection. This offers two potential realities described in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jengleruk/status/1335925369074036738\" title=\"Jonathan Engler on Vaccines and Lockdowns 1/2\">this Twitter thread</a>: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>A reduction in symptoms will assist managing the virus as most spread is associated with symptoms, in which case what is the value of lockdowns and restrictions over the simple self isolation of those with symptoms.</li>\n<li>A reduction in symptoms will not assist managing the virus, as asymptomatic spread is a major factor.  Which if true, whilst welcoming the extra protection afforded to the vulnerable, makes it illogical to view vaccines as a pre-requisite to get life back to normal. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Logically, once vulnerable groups have <strong>voluntarily</strong> been vaccinated or protected by other means, we must end societal restrictions and stop the collateral public health and economic harms being done to society.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Fear can be an incredibly powerful motivator of human behavior. As we stand in the wake of biological evolutionary change at the hands of a seemingly uncontainable viral agent, we are faced with serious questions about how we approach managing this pandemic, and ultimately, the next.  Our approach has held young adults accountable for the spread of infectious disease, while we work to reduce the risk for the most privileged and lowest-risk members of society. A more equitable and rational response would focus on helping those with symptoms to self isolate, providing the knowledge and tools needed to make socialization safer, and providing resources for those whose occupations and living situations put them at high-risk. </p>\n<h2></h2>","excerpt":"There is no doubt that the world is in the midst of a pivotal watershed event.
